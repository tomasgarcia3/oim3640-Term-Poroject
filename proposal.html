    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h4>What is your website about?</h4>
    <p>My website is about Kitesurfing, more specifically will be about traveling the world looking for places to practice the sport. I will like to show people the best locations around the world to kitesurf.</p>
    <h4>What is the objective of your website?</h4>
    <p>Essentially my website will be a place for people looking to travel the world while being able to kitesurf. This is something I am passionate about. I don't take a lot of vacations a year but when I do I like to practice my favorite hobby which is kitesurfing. Along the way, I have found some travel blogs but is sometimes difficult to find all the options in one place. The purpose of this website will be to talk about 5 of the 7 continents in the world, and show which are some of the best sports to kitesurf in those regions. </p>
    <h4>Who is your target audience?</h4>
    <p>My target audience is kitesurfers like myself who look to spend a vacation in a foreign country and take advantage of practicing the sport there.</p>
    <h4>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h4>
    <p>The following list of continents will represent a page on my website. The contents of each page will have the same topic but differ in information. I will talk about the best kitesurfing spots in countries located on these continents. The pages will include images and information about these places. I don't know how detailed the information would be but I will reference what makes these places so special, how easy it is to get to those places, and provide basic pricing information</p>
